Adds a system for integrating AE2 and Replication.
A block is added called AE2-Replication Bridge which allows AE2 to read the Replication netowrk

 

Specifically: 
  - Allows the amount of Replication matter within the Applied Energistics 2 terminals to be displayed.
  - Enables Replication requests to be made to AE2 systems.
